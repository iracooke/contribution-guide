# Marine Omics Contribution Guide

All projects in Marine Omics should aim to be *publication ready* almost from the first commit.  In essence this means that;

	- Anyone who finds the project should be able to check it out, follow the README and run it
	- The project should be complete in the sense that instructions are provided for obtaining all raw data and running any analyses not included in the repository
	- The project should be clean in the sense that it contains only the files needed to run the analyses
